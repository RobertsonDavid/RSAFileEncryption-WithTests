*Inputs taken as args

The RSA program will take an initial input of one number. 
	This number is used to gauge the size of public and private keys to be created.
  	The keys will be output to a public.txt and a private.txt file
  	These are then used for encryption and decryption

The program will then be able to take an input of either <-decrypt> or <-encrypt> as well as a filename
	it will then create a new file with either the encrypted or decrypted data. This file will have an appended extension of either .enc or .cop.

There is also a file containing automated tests for this program.
